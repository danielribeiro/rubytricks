PaulGrahamSidebar
======

PaulGrahamSidebar is a Sinatra app that skins the original [essays from Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html). It essentially inserts on all pages the [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/pt-BR/firefox/addon/748) [plugin I wrote](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/75633) for this purpose, therefore allowing people to use it without needing Greasemonkey.

This is currently deployed on <http://paulgrahamsidebar.heroku.com>, but feel free to deploy anywhere you want.


Deploy
------

Deploy the app to Heroku:

    gem install heroku
    heroku create
    git push heroku master
    heroku open
